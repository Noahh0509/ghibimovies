                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Grave of the Fireflies</i></b> is a 1988 Japanese animated historical war drama film written and directed by Isao Takahata, and produced by Studio Ghibli. It is based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, it tells the story of siblings and war orphans Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Pacific War.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Production of Grave of the Fireflies began after Akiyuki Nosaka became interested in an animated adaptation of his book. The film was Takahata's first with Studio Ghibli. Several critics consider Grave of the Fireflies an anti-war film, but Takahata has disputed this claim. The film stars Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi, Yoshiko Shinohara and Akemi Yamaguchi. It was theatrically released on April 16, 1988.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon release, the film was universally acclaimed by critics, with particular praise toward its emotional weight. It was also modestly successful at the Japanese box office, grossing ¥1.7 Billion. Grave of the Fireflies has been considered to be Isao Takahata's magnum opus as well as one of the greatest animated films ever made, and is recognized as a major work of Japanese animation.
